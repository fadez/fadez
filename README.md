## 🎉 Welcome to my profile

👋 Hello, I'm **Alex**!

I'm a **Senior Full-Stack Web Developer** with **over 10 years** of professional experience building, deploying, and maintaining real-world web applications.

I have deep expertise in the **[Laravel](https://laravel.com)** and **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)** ecosystems, delivering end-to-end solutions — from initial architecture and design to scaling high-performance, enterprise-grade web platforms.

Throughout my career, I've created many projects from scratch working as a solo developer, and have had great experience working on large projects with a big team of developers.

I like to get things done — plain and simple.
